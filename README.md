# Brewlis: Simple Lisp Interpreter in Rust

## Overview
This project is a basic Lisp interpreter implemented in Rust, aimed primarily at learning and exploring the Rust programming language. The interpreter is minimalistic, yet functional, providing a hands-on approach to understanding both Lisp and Rust.

## Features
- Basic interpretation of Lisp code.
- Simple and intuitive error handling.
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies.

## Open
- Only floats, no strings, no integer
